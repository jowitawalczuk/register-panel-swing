## Funcionality
The parent functionality comes down to:
- registration of new users (checking if entered data meet the registration conditions ex. password containing at least 6 characters etc., saving user data into excel spreadsheet)

## Setup
In order to make this program to work I used listed below .jar files. 
* common-collections4-4.4
* poi-5.0.0
* poi-excelant-5.0.0
* poi-examples-5.0.0
* poi-ooxml-5.0.0
* poi-scratchpad-5.0.0
* poi-ooxml-full-5.0.0

You can download it from [_mvn repository_](https://mvnrepository.com/).

If you are using IntelliJ IDEA IDE adding those into your project takes place as follows:
-> File -> Project Structure... -> Modules -> Dependencies -> + -> JARs and Directiories -> ...

Note: There is a posibility that not all of them are necessary (if so please, let me know :))
 
## Project Status
Project is no longer being worked on due widespreading lack of interest in Swing.

## Room for Improvement
* This application has sentimental value and is not intended for other purposes
